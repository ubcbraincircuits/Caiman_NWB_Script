# Caiman_NWB_Script

The demo_pipeline_NWB_DMBCH.ipynb runs caiman analysis on a .tif file; the analysis as well as the raw data is then stored as an NWB file.

The NWB_dF_F.ipynb allows for further analysis on the dF/F data and also saves it in the same NWB file generated with when we ran caiman.

Please note that these scripts are slightly different from the ones provided when Caiman is installed; they have been adjusted to better suit the needs of the centre.
Also note that these scripts are meant to be run in Jupyter notebook.

Additional note: I have provided the cropped .tif files I have used in order to run Caiman analysis: <br>
m3_00002_cropped1.tif <br>
m3_00002_cropped2.tif <br>
m3_00002_cropped3.tif <br>

I have also provided the NWB and memory mapped files generated from doing so for each corresponding .tif file.
